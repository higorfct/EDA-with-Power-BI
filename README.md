# 📊 Dashboard Analysis of Municipal Spending and GDP

This Power BI dashboard analyzes the relationship between **public spending obligations** and **wealth generation (GDP)** across different municipalities in a brazilian State called Rio Grande do Sul.

---

## ❌ Problem Identified
The data reveals that **a significant portion of public budget is being allocated inefficiently**.  
Some municipalities receive high levels of spending obligations but do not show proportional economic growth.  
This imbalance **costs money**, as resources could be redirected to regions with greater economic return potential.

- **High spending, low return:**  
  Municipalities such as **Santana do Livramento** and **São Gabriel** rank among the highest in public spending obligations but do not appear in the top GDP ranking.

- **Spending concentration:**  
  A few municipalities concentrate most of the spending obligations, creating risks of regional imbalance and inefficient allocation.

- **Efficient municipalities:**  
  Cities such as **Carazinho** and **Santa Vitória do Palmar** appear in the top GDP ranking despite not being among the highest in spending, suggesting higher efficiency in resource utilization.

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Reevaluate budget allocation:**  
  Prioritize municipalities that show stronger ability to convert spending into economic growth.

- **Develop efficiency indicators:**  
  Create metrics that relate public spending to GDP growth in order to identify where money delivers the highest impact.

- **Reduce inefficiencies:**  
  Review and control high spending levels in municipalities that do not show proportional economic returns.
